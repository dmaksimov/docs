# Layouts

> Layouts are different ways to view or even interact with data on the Item Browse page. Directus includes List and Card layouts out-of-the-box, but others can easily be created to fit specific needs.

## Core Layouts

* **List** — The system default and fallback, this layout is a tabular view that will work with any type of data. It allows you to choose visible columns, sort by specific column data, reorder with drag-and-drop, and more.
* **Card** — Ideal for image-based collections, this layout showcases an image thumbnail with configurable text fields below. It is the default layout for the User Directory and File Library.

## Custom Layouts

These are other potential layouts that could be created to view specific types of data.

* **Map** — Ideal for location based data, this could show each item as a pin on a map.
* **Player** — Ideal for audio file data, this could show the normal List layout with play buttons and a fixed player across the bottom.
* **Calendar** — Ideal for date-time based data, this would show each item as an event on a calendar.
* **Split** — Similar to the List layout, instead of navigating to the Item Detail page when clicking an item, it is opened in a right pane directly on the browse page. Great when you need to quickly see or manage items without losing your place.
* **Spreadsheet** — Also similar to the List layout, this view would work best with "raw" data that can easily be edited _inline_ by clicking into individual cells.
* **Chart** — This is an example of a read-only layout. Here we show the item's data presented as a configurable chart. For instance, you could then toggle between viewing Sales as a normal list and as a chart of data over time.
* **To-Do** — Some layouts could be tailored to specific collection data or functionality. For example, a To-Do list layout might contain dedicated features to nest todos or mark them as complete.
