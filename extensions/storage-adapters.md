# Storage Adapters

> Storage Adapters allow you to save Directus files anywhere. The default storage adapter is the API server's filesystem, but you can also use the included adapter for AWS-S3 or create your own.

## Core Adapters

* **Filesystem** – Store files on the API server's filesystem
* **AWS S3** – Store files on Amazon's Simple Storage Service
* **Rackconnect** – Store files on Rackspace's storage solution

:::tip
You can change your project's default storage adapter within the [API configuration](../advanced/api/configure.html#storage).
