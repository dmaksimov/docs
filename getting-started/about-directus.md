## What is Directus?

**Directus is an open-source suite of software for managing content in custom databases.** It instantly wraps SQL databases with a dynamic API and provides a safe and intuitive Admin App for non-technical users. It can be used as a headless CMS for managing project content, a database client for modeling and viewing raw data, or as standalone software to replace other costly services.

Yes, this is a very broad description. Directus is a simple solution for complex problems.

## Core Principles

Every aspect of Directus is data-first and guided by the following core principles:

* **Agnostic** — Directus is not specific to websites or limited to HTML. Your data is compatible with any platform or device so you can connect it to all of your projects.
* **Extensible** — Directus can not be outgrown. Every aspect of the toolkit is modular, allowing you to adapt, customize, and extend the Core feature-set.
* **Limitless** — Directus does not impose any arbitrary restrictions or limits. Add as many users, roles, locales, collections, items, or environments as you'd like.
* **Open** — Directus is not a closed, obfuscated, or black-boxed system. Its simple codebase public and transparent so you can audit the data flow from end-to-end.
* **Portable** — Directus does not _lock_ you to its platform or services. You can migrate your data elsewhere at any point — or just delete Directus and connect to your database directly.
* **Pure** — Directus does not alter your data or store it in a predefined or proprietary way. All system data is stored elsewhere, never commingled.
* **Unopinionated** — Directus does not impose any self-proclaimed "best practices". It lets you decide how your data is modeled, managed, and accessed.
